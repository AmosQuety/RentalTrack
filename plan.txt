🔄 PROBLEM: MANUAL APP REFRESH REQUIRED
THE PROBLEM:
When users perform actions like adding tenants or recording payments, the changes don't appear immediately in the app. Users have to close and reopen the entire application to see updated data, which is inconvenient and creates a poor user experience.

WHERE IT HAPPENS:
Adding new tenants

Recording payments

Editing tenant information

Any data changes that should update lists or statistics

ROOT CAUSE:
The app screens load data only once when they open, but don't automatically refresh when the underlying database changes.

🛠️ SOLUTIONS NEEDED:
1. AUTOMATIC SCREEN REFRESHES
Refresh tenant list immediately after adding/editing tenants

Update dashboard statistics after any financial changes

Refresh tenant details after recording payments

Update analytics after data modifications

2. PULL-TO-REFRESH FEATURE
Add pull-down to refresh on all list screens

Allow manual refresh when users want latest data

Show loading indicators during refresh

3. NAVIGATION-AWARE UPDATES
Automatically refresh data when returning to a screen

Update screens when they come back into view

Ensure data is current after any user action

4. BETTER USER FEEDBACK
Show success messages after actions

Display loading states during operations

Provide clear indication when data is updating

🎯 END GOAL:
Users should see all their changes immediately without ever needing to close and reopen the app. The app should feel responsive, live, and always show current data.

Priority: High - This directly impacts user satisfaction and app usability.
